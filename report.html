    <h1>Name:Jignesh Devji</h1>
    
    <h2>Story Being Told by my website</h2>
    
    <p>My website is a home for everyone who is obseesed with new forms of technology (particulary gadgets). It provides everything a technology enthusuaist would enjoy and engage in from      lots of interesting stories on the new where some form of technology has made an appearance to an expo which is aimed directly at tech lovers. The structure of my website is very     simple and each page consists of section tags segregating all of the different parts of it. Further into the structure I have used DIV tags to divide all of the different elements on each page.  </p>
    
    <h2>3 things that inpired me whilst creating this webiste were: </h2>
    <p>1.The guest speaker who spoke to us about web development in one of the lectures who also marked my webpage for the group website project</p>
    <p>2.A selection of web developers who are professionals and make a series of youtube videos aimed at beginners like myself on how to go about creating a good website</p>
    <p>3.I was also inpsired by websites such as www.newscientist.com as I went to these to get the content for my articles and observed how they had layed out their content.</p>
    
    
    <h2> 3 things that make my website accessable</h2>
    <p>1.I have added alt tags to all of my images so the blind can still see a description of them.</p>
    <p>2. The elemnts in my website are of a good size and should be visible to all different types of people with different eye sight levels </p>
    <p>3.My website doesnt contain any flashing images as this may effect people who suffer from epileptic seizures which is a seriouse health issue.</p>
    
    <h2>3 things that make my website usuable</h2>
    <p>1. one way in which my website is usuable is that all of the content is places neatly into differnt places making it easy for people to find what threy are looking for </p>
    <p>2.the website contains simple javascript coding and doesnt contain anything that would not be compatible on older web browsers on older operating systems</p>
    <p>3.my websites responsiveness partially works and people who are using tablets and for some pages mobile phones aswell, can see all of the content on the web pages.</p>
    
    <h2>3 things i learnt when creating this website</h2>
    
    <p>1. I had to leanr how to create an image carousel using basic javascript code. I did this by making a search onn youtube and watching a video on a web developers channel</p>
    <p>2.I had to figure out how to make images and buttons links to other pages using a basic javascript line of code. I found this out from a contributer to stack overflow.</p>
    <p>3. I had to learn how to use jquery to show and hide div tags as i needed this core peiece of functionality for the news articles. I learnt this from a person on youtube too.</p>
    
    
    <h2>what aspets of my work I think worked well</h2>
    <p>the coding for my expo and news article page worked really well as the code does exactly what i had in mind when i was visualising and planning this website and theres nothing that I would change about that. Also the DOM manipulation was implementated by me successfully as I thought I would encounter problems trying to do this. </p>
    
    
    <h2>What apsects of my work can be improved</h2>
    <p>The form on the first page in responsive to input in a sence that it can detect when an incorect type of input has been entered by the user and warns you of this but however it doesnt do anything when the user clicks the submit button. Next time i will create a pop up message that responds to the user when they input information so that the user knows they have completed the form successfully.</p>
